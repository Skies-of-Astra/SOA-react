# Our design system

<div className="width-60 margin_bottom_med">

This design system represents the source of truth for all of Skies of Astra's digital channels.

The SOA Design System includes resources to create user interfaces consistent with the SOA design language. Instead of focusing on the minutae, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience and flows.

## Design system structure

<p className="margin_bottom_med width-60">
  The design system at it's heart is a collection of basic building blocks that
  allow for complex patterns to be built. By using atomic principles we can
  logically split the design system into 3 core units:{" "}
  <b>tokens, components and patterns.</b>
</p>

### Tokens

<p className="margin_bottom_med width-60">
  We define tokens as the raw style values of UI elements, such as colors, sizes
  and spacing. Tokens form the base (atomic) layer of the design system.
</p>

### Components

<p className="margin_bottom_med width-60">
  The simplest building blocks to create the UI, such as text blocks, titles and
  buttons. These are built by combining tokens together.
</p>

### Patterns

<p className="margin_bottom_med width-60">
  Patterns define specific UI elements that are required by the app, these are
  contructed by combining multiple components together.
</p>
